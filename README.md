# Messenger-with-ordering-guarantees.
<p>
A simple android based messenger with provides FIFO, causal and total ordering guarantees for messages. This kind of guarantees are used by common messenger services to ensure message ordering. I have implemented ISIS algorithm to provide ordering guarantees.

There is at most one node failure in the middle of conversation. This implementation ensures that even under failed node scenario, other nodes do not wait for responses/proposals from the failed node. In other words, even when a node is crashed, messages do not stall and still provide FIFO total ordering.
